# Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection-on-HealthCare-Providers-Dataset
---
## Overview  
This project focuses on identifying anomalies in healthcare provider data using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information such as provider identifiers, services rendered, and payment amounts. The primary goal is to detect unusual patterns or outliers that deviate significantly from the norm.

## Workflow

### 1. *Data Preprocessing*
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
- Adjusted column data types for consistency.
- Visualized the data to understand distributions and correlations.
- Encoded categorical columns using:
  - *One-Hot Encoding*
  - *Frequency Encoding*

### 2. *Outlier Removal*
- Experimented with:
  - *Z-score Method*
  - *IQR Method*
- Finalized the *IQR Method* for outlier removal.

### 3. *Anomaly Detection*
- Applied multiple anomaly detection techniques:
  - *Isolation Forest* (best-performing model)
  - *DBSCAN*
  - *One-Class SVM*
-Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - *Grid Search with GridSearchCV
  - *Randomized Search
  - *Optimization using Optuna
- Evaluated models using:
  - *Silhouette Score*
  - *Calinski-Harabasz Score*
- Compared results using a confusion matrix.

### 4. *Autoencoder Implementation*
- Designed a *vanilla autoencoder* for anomaly detection.
- Tuned parameters and visualized reconstruction error.
- Compared autoencoder results with the Isolation Forest to finalize the best-performing model.
